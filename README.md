This project is a re-build of the AWS Serverless Airline Booking system with latest Vue, Quasar and AWS Amplify libraries. It was created due to the struggles of trying to follow the original videos that were created and how quickly this kind of technology moves ahead.

The original README is shown below.

## AWS Serverless Airline Booking

Airline Booking is a complete web application that provides Flight Search, Flight Payment, Flight Booking, Flight Preferences and Loyalty points including end-to-end testing, GraphQL and CI/CD. This web application is the theme of [Build on Serverless Season 2 on AWS Twitch running from April 24th until August 7th](https://pages.awscloud.com/GLOBAL-devstrategy-OE-BuildOnServerless-2019-reg-event.html).
